# Weather Forcasting

This project aims to predict weather patterns using historical weather data. The notebook applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to forecast weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

Project Structure:
*Data Loading and Preprocessing: Prepares raw weather data by cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features.  
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes key trends and relationships between weather variables.  
*Model Training and Evaluation: Builds and evaluates machine learning models(Facebook prophet) for weather forecasting.
